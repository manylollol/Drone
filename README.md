## Usage
1. 3D print the drone frame (PLA recommended).  
2. Assemble motors, ESCs, flight controller, battery, and propellers according to design.  
3. Connect Raspberry Pi Pico and sensors for environmental data collection.  
4. Test flight carefully in a safe area.  
5. Monitor stability, propeller performance, and sensor readings during flight.

## Notes
- CAD models and propeller designs are included in the `CAD/` folder.  
- Electronics diagrams and PCB designs are in `Electronics/`.  
- See `Journal/JournalEntries.md` for the step-by-step design and assembly process.  
- Check all connections carefully before powering on to prevent damage.  
- Adjust propeller choice and motor speeds based on testing for optimal lift and stability.
