## 10/21/2025 - Research  

I started looking into making my own drone. I found this small DIY drone kit online that got my attention because it already has most of the main parts like motors, propellers, and a controller. I did some reaserch about how drones fly and what parts are important like the flight control board, battery, and how the propellers spin in diffrent directions.

Iâ€™m planing to 3D print my own frame later and maybe even make my own PCB to connect all parts cleanly. This first step was mostly about learning how it all works and seeing what parts are needed to get it flying.
