## 10/21/2025 3 PM - Research  

I started looking into making my own drone. I found this small DIY drone kit online that got my attention because it already has most of the main parts like motors, propellers, and a controller. I did some reaserch about how drones fly and what parts are important like the flight control board, battery, and how the propellers spin in diffrent directions.

I’m planing to 3D print my own frame later and maybe even make my own PCB to connect all parts cleanly. This first step was mostly about learning how it all works and seeing what parts are needed to get it flying.

Spent around 3 to 4 ![Screenshot 2025-10-21 155749.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6Mzk4NSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--b376e2173ae73414502561650d5a479675ec46fb/Screenshot%202025-10-21%20155749.png)
 hour looking at diffrent options and learning how drones are built.  

## 10/21/2025 4:02 PM - Planning and Sourcing Parts  

Reaserching the necessory part required for the drone, found a kit which includes these all parts.

4 × Brushless DC motors 

4 × ESCs (Electronic Speed Controllers)

1 × Flight controller (like an F4 or F7 board)

1 × LiPo battery (3S or 4S depending on motor spec)

1 × Transmitter + Receiver (for remote control)

1 × 3D-printed or carbon fiber frame!!!!!

Propellers (matched to the motor size)

Screws, wires, connectors, solder, srink tape, etc.  

## 10/21/2025 4:19 PM - Designing the Drone on CAD (Onshape)  

Started designing the drone frame in Onshape, adding mounts for motors, battery, and controller. Tried to make it light and balanced so it can be 3D printed later. I’ll be using PLA since its cheaper and I can ask my school to print it. The CAD for the drone case took longer than I expected because I didn’t have some of the skills needed, so I watched YouTube tutorials about mounting and chamfer tools to help me finish it. Changed the original design to this one beacusee this is lighter and more effective.

## 10/21/2025 4:22 PM - Reaserching Propellers  

Started looking into how drone propellers work. Found that size and pitch changes how fast and stable it flys. Bigger ones give more lift but use more power. Gonna test with 4 small propellers for lighter weight.
