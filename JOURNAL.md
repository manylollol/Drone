## 10/21/2025 3 PM - Research  

I started looking into making my own drone. I found this small DIY drone kit online that got my attention because it already has most of the main parts like motors, propellers, and a controller. I did some reaserch about how drones fly and what parts are important like the flight control board, battery, and how the propellers spin in diffrent directions.

I’m planing to 3D print my own frame later and maybe even make my own PCB to connect all parts cleanly. This first step was mostly about learning how it all works and seeing what parts are needed to get it flying.

Spent around 3 to 4 ![Screenshot 2025-10-21 155749.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6Mzk4NSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--b376e2173ae73414502561650d5a479675ec46fb/Screenshot%202025-10-21%20155749.png)
 hour looking at diffrent options and learning how drones are built.  

## 10/21/2025 4:02 PM - Planning and Sourcing Parts  

I spent some time researching the necessary parts for the drone and found a kit that includes most of what I need:

4 × Brushless DC motors

4 × ESCs (Electronic Speed Controllers)

1 × Flight controller (F4 or F7)

1 × LiPo battery (3S or 4S)

1 × Transmitter + Receiver

1 × 3D-printed or carbon fiber frame

Propellers (matched to the motor size)

Screws, wires, connectors, solder, shrink tape, etc.

I also plan to add 2 extra components not i![Screenshot 2025-10-21 160228.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6Mzk5OCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--6f6bdbaba58f9a2428a9b1f21114a9e67b890ed4/Screenshot%202025-10-21%20160228.png)
ncluded in the kit:

Raspberry Pi Pico Mini RP2040-ZERO – a microcontroller board with a dual-core RP2040 processor

GY-BME280-3.3 sensor – digital sensor for temperature, humidity, and barometric pressure (I2C/SPI)

These additions will help me gather environmental data like weather and surroundings while flying the drone.  

## 10/21/2025 4:19 PM - Designing the Drone on CAD (Onshape)  

Started designing the drone frame in Onshape, adding mounts for motors, battery, and controller. Tried to make it light and balanced so it can be 3D printed later. I’ll be using PLA since its cheaper and I can ask my school to print it. The CAD for the drone case took longer than I expected because I didn’t have some of the skills needed, so I watched YouTube tutorials about mounting and chamfer tools to help me finish it. Changed the original design to this one beacusee this is lighter and more effective.

## 10/21/2025 4:22 PM - Reaserching Propellers  

Started looking into how drone propellers work. Found that size and pitch changes how fast and stable it flys. Bigger ones give more lift but use more power. Gonna test with 4 small propellers for lighter weight.

## 10/21/2025 4:26 PM - Inital Designing CAD Propellers  

After my research, I found two suitable propellers: a Toroidal-style propeller and a normal 2-wing propeller. I created both designs in CAD using Onshape, adjusting their shapes and sizes to fit the drone frame. The designs are ready for the next steps. My second propeeler was really hard to CAD so i used a tutorial to help me a little bit. ![Screenshot 2025-10-21 161340.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6Mzk5MSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--c8aa0a69523a67f940c3b4d2889be47bbcd102a9/Screenshot%202025-10-21%20161340.png)

## 10/21/2025 4:30 PM - Final Design for propeller   

I spent about 30 mins looking at both propellers to choose the final one. I didn’t have a 3D printer at home during half-term so I just tried to figure out which one would be better for the drone. After thinking about it, I picked the 2-wing propeller as my final design.![Screenshot 2025-10-21 161733.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6Mzk5NiwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--87b9343c5a2b54bfdee97977d8eb23b88ef59889/Screenshot%202025-10-21%20161733.png)
  

## 10/21/2025 4:34 PM - Assembling the Drone on CAD - Onshape  

Next, I worked on putting everything together on Onshape. I started assembling the drone casing and then added the propeller I chose. It was exciting to see how the pieces fit and start looking like a real drone. I made sure the propeller was positioned correctly and everything was tight and balanced. I also checked that the sizes matched the electronics and could handle the weight of everything. I plan to use this drone to check the surroundings and the weather, like for environmental purposes.
